# Nature Walks in Ebbsfleet Garden City

## Next Walk:

- Thursday 11am or 2pm tbc

We'll walk along the high footpath with views across Castle Hill and the Garden City, exploring the plants and insects we find along the way. With a chance to get a close up look at bugs with viewing pots, ask me about our local bumblebees and what plants are good for them, and see where you might find slow worms or snakes hiding out of sight. We'll climb over the foot style next to the Keary Road Allotments, and walk through the forested path where there are dormice footprint tunnels, fox holes, woodland plants - and plenty of litter to be picked up!

## Accessibility information:

The first part of the walk is more accessible with steps or a slope up the hill, and a wide gravel path which winds along our route. The latter part of the walk by the alotments has a style to climb over and a farely steep hill, and the rest of the track is wooded and can be difficult to walk on, so people should take care here. An alternative access point to avoid the styles is available on Whitecliffe road across from Garden City Corridor Park, which is on a slope. Alternatively the whitecliffe road is paved and the road passes the Castle Hill Garden City park with our ending point being the North corner of the junction of Whitecliffe and Southfleet roads.

I recommend to do this walk in the direction outlined, as there can be a lot of rubbish in the wooded path from the allotments, so any heavy carrying can be done towards the end of the route.
